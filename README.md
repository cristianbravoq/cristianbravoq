- 👋 Hi, I’m @cristianbravoq
- 👀 I am interested in learning and contributing my knowledge to projects that work on intuitive and secure interfaces.
- 🌱 I am currently teaching JavaScript and frameworks, I have a project called Bonsai which optimises education from the perspective that we all have different ways of learning and that this should be considered when approaching a specific subject.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in Front-End development and web layout.
